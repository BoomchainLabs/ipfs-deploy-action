# Deploy to IPFS Action

This GitHub Action allows you to deploy static sites to IPFS using Storacha with CAR files. It supports optional pinning to Pinata and uploading to Filebase. The action will automatically create a preview link and update your PR/commit status with the deployment information.

The [composite action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/sharing-automations/creating-actions/about-custom-actions#composite-actions) makes no assumptions about your build process. You should just run your build and then call this action with the `path-to-deploy` input set to the path to the build directory.

## Features

- üì¶ Merkleizes your static site into a CAR file
- üöÄ Uploads to IPFS via Storacha
- üìç Optional pinning to Pinata
- üíæ Optional backup to Filebase
- üîó Automatic preview links
- üí¨ PR comments with deployment info
- ‚úÖ Commit status updates

## How does this compare to the other IPFS actions?

This action encapsulates some of the established best practices for deploying static sites to IPFS in 2025:

- Merkleizes the build into a CAR file in GitHub Actions using `ipfs-car`. This ensures that the CID is generated in the build process and is the same across multiple providers.
- Uploads the CAR file to IPFS via [Storacha](https://storacha.network).
- Optionally pins the CID of the CAR file to Pinata. This is useful for redundancy (multiple providers). The pinning here is done in the background and non-blocking. (When pinning, Pinata will fetch the data from Storacha.)
- Updates the PR/commit status with the deployment information and preview links.
